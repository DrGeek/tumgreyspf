Once you install the RPM, you need to configure Postfix to use tumgreyspf.
This is so that installing the RPM doesn't risk breaking an existing mail

After installing the RPM, you will need to read the README and follow
either the QUICKSTART INSTALL.  Or, for more detailed installation
instructions, go to the INSTALL section and start with the CONFIGURING
POSTFIX.
