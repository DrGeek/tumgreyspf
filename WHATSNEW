================================
Version 1.19 -- Wed Jun 07, 2006

Mike Meyer noticed that unnecessary data was being written to the greylist
      directory, potentially using unnecessary data blocks.  Corrected.

================================
Version 1.18 -- Tue May 30, 2006

Changed tumgreyspfsupp.py so that defaultConfigFilename is consistent with
      example settings in other files.  This only impacts users who are not
      installing via the RPM.  Reported by Luis Botero

================================
Version 1.17 -- Tue Mar 21, 2006

Changing the __default__.dist file to list SPF first, since the
      documentation recommends it be set that way.
      Suggested by Benjamin Derry.
Changing the spec file so that the cron.d file is mode 644.  Reported by
      Stephen Warren.

================================
Version 1.16 -- Fri Feb 24, 2006

1.15 had a bug in indentation.  Ugh.  Reported by Benjamin Derry.

Version 1.13 -- Sun Feb 05, 2006

Another patch from Scott Scriven to fix the tumgreyspf-clean program for
      the "ignoreLastByte" patch from Thursday.

================================
Version 1.12 -- Thu Feb 02, 2006

A patch from Scott Scriven which implements a new setting,
      "ignoreLastByte".  When set, the last byte of the IP address is
      ignored so that mail servers in a pool of the same /24 network block
      can more easily get mail through.  This defaults to off.

================================
Version 1.11 -- Sat Oct 01, 2005

Adding documentation about file-system problems when using ext2/ext3
      and how to avoid them.

================================
Version 1.10 -- Fri Sep 30, 2005

defaultSeedOnly was not implemented, Sean E. Millichamp provided a patch to
      implement it.
Some SPF versions return "deny" instead of "fail".  Sean E. Millichamp
      supplied a patch which treats both responses the same.

================================
Version 1.09 -- Wed Aug 31, 2005

Changing the install instructions to use different syntax for the main.cf
      file.  (Reported by Ferdinand Schmid)
Modifying the python version used by the programs.  System was using
      "python2.2", changed to just use "python".
      (Reported by Ferdinand Schmid)

================================
Version 1.08 -- Wed Apr 27, 2005

Changed the regex used for processing the files, fixing problems with
      addresses that have "=" in them.  Fix provided by Stephen Warren

================================
Version 1.07 -- Wed Apr 27, 2005

Debugging in tumgreyspf could cause tracebacks due to logging the wrong
      value.  Fix provided by Stephen Warren.

Changing the install script to indent second line of master.cf file
      (reported by Stephen Warren)
Got a report from Stephen Warren that "tumgreyspf-install" does not work in
      a number of ways with his pre-existing postfix configuration files.
      I've changed the README to recommend doing a manual install instead
      of automatic.

================================
Version 1.04 -- Thu Apr 14, 2005

Changed the README to reflect GPL status.

================================
Version 1.03 -- Tue Mar 15, 2005

Added LICENSE file for GPL.

================================
Version 1.02 -- Wed Nov 10, 2004

No configuration of the main program is necessary now.
Greylist data file ctime/atime is now updated when a new message comes in.
